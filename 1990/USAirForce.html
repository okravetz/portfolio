<h2>Analysis of legacy applications and recommendation including design system (2018)</h2>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>The U.S. Air Force engaged Isobar to analyze its myriad Human Resources applications and systems and make a
    recommendation for a unified system moving forward.</p>
<p>We spent weeks doing in-person, contextual interviews to learn how the airmen responsible for overseeing the Air
    Forceâ€™s vast amount of personnel and roles perform their jobs. We saw how many different desktop and web
    applications they used and how they augmented those systems with spreadsheets, email, paper, and more.</p>
<p>We distilled the research into two overarching issues faced by the airmen. First, there was slew of inconsistent and
    outdated user interfaces. The second issue was that the information they needed to know or act on the most was
    buried in various app silos. The engineers were developing a new unified platform to host all the data currently
    displayed on hundreds of apps. To help make this system usable, predictable, and consistent, I developed a modular
    design system.</p>
<p>The design system allows the user to switch between various tools, while maintaining a single location for incoming
    notifications and consistent design and interaction for interface controls. This way the airmen could get their work
    done quicker and more efficiently and training new airmen would be simpler, too.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>There are few research tools as valuable as a contextual inquiry. Without them, on this project, we would have left
    with just evaluating the interface of each application and judging it on industry-standard heuristics. Instead, we
    were able to glean so many valuable insights about how the tools and people worked together and how the airmen
    developed strategies for coping with the deficiencies before them. And our final recommendations were more
    trustworthy and complete for having integrated that data.</p>
