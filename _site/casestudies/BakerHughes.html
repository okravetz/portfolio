<p>Baker Hughes is an energy technology company that builds oil and natural gas rigs, all the requisite parts for the rigs, and offers services and support for their products. In 2007, Baker Hughes had joined General Electric, but were poised to become independent again at the end of 2019. Firstborn and Isobar were hired to help launch a new, responsive website that would be separate from General Electric and that would align with the new brand.</p>

<p>We were initially tasked with defining the minimum viable product—the least that Baker Hughes would need to announce it’s brand—for launch three months later. We would then go on in the second phase,to evolve the MVP design for the full transformation of their old digital presence.</p>

<p>Initially, during Phase 1, we were trying to balance having a minimal, menu-less primary navigation bar with allowing the user to browse the full depth of products and services. The product tree could be 8 levels deep in places. So I developed two options for secondary and tertiary navigation of products and services on a single page.</p>

<p>After the client reacted positively to the navigation in the first option and the product layout of the second option we started to flesh out a combined solution. However, one we stepped back and discussed the options with our engineering team, we realized we wouldn’t have time to put anything so complicated into place. Additionally, while the client’s product team liked the solution, the business units were still trying to determine how the products and services would be grouped on the new website.</p>

<p>So in our next iteration, we made the decision that for MVP, the site would only feature their two most important product solutions. These would each get detailed pages of their own, and keep the navigation simple for the initial launch.</p>

<p>When we then turned to designing the product pages for the full site transformation, we were able to develop a richer navigation system both in the navigation bar and on the page.</p>

<h3 id="learnings">Learnings</h3>

<p>Despite the close collaboration between our team and the client’s team, there could have been more honest communication about our respective visions for the site early on when defining the MVP. Our ambitions designs didn’t align with how they were redefining themselves and led to an outsized amount of time being allocated to iterating on the navigation and product pages.</p>
