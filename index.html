      Oren is a User Experience Designer with formal training and experience in
      user research, wireframing, interaction design, usability testing, and
      prototyping.

      As an Experience Design Lead at Isobar, Oren has both been responsible for
      project threads and has lead a team of junior designers through the design
      process from user research and product definition through launch. These
      projects include responsive solutions that account for various screen
      sizes, including desktop, tablet, phone, large monitors and TVs. He has
      also facilitated increased collaboration between the design team,
      developers, and business analysts. Between projects, Oren presented his
      work to the wider UX design community at Isobar, helped manage the New
      York Device Lab, and is actively involved in the NowLab.

      Oren's experience at Isobar includes designing websites, mobile apps,
      desktop applications, and large-scale web applications for clients such as
      Bloomberg, Sotheby's, MSCI, D. E. Shaw, NBCUniversal, Google, Umpqua Bank,
      The Wall Street Journal, IntegraMed, the U.S. Air Force, Genral Motors,
      Altar'd State, Flexport, Baker Hughes, and Cisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oren's other interests include visual and creative design—especially
      photography and typography—and working the latest, cutting-edge
      technologies such as wearables, smart things, and VR/AR/MR experiences.
