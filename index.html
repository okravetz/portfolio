      As an Experience Design Lead at Isobar, Oren has both been responsible for
      project threads and has lead a team of junior designers through the design
      process from user research and product definition through launch. These
      projects include responsive solutions that account for various screen

      York Device Lab, and is actively involved in the NowLab.
