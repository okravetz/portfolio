    <p>Oren just wrapped up a two-year detailed design effort for web-based patient and clinical portals for
        fertility clinics that have partnered with IntegraMed. He also worked closely with the developers to

        TVs. He has also facilitated increased collaboration between the design team, developers, and business
        analysts. Between projects, Oren presented his work to the wider UX design community at Isobar, helped
        manage the New York Device Lab, and is actively involved in the NowLab.</p>
    <p>Oren's experience at Isobar includes designing mobile apps, desktop applications, and large-scale web
        applications for clients such as Bloomberg, Sotheby's, MSCI, D. E. Shaw, NBCUniversal, Google, Umpqua
        Bank, The Wall Street Journal, IntegraMed, the U.S. Air Force, Genral Motors, Altar'd State, Flexport,
        Baker Hughes, and Cisco.</p>
    <p>Oren's other interests include visual and creative design—especially photography and typography—and
        working the latest, cutting-edge technologies such as wearables, smart things, and VR/AR/MR experiences.
    </p>
