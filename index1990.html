<h2 name="bio">Bio</h2>
<p>Oren is a User Experience Designer with formal training and experience in user research, wireframing,
    interaction design, usability testing, and prototyping.</p>
<p>Oren just wrapped up a two-year detailed design effort for web-based patient and clinical portals for
    fertility clinics that have partnered with IntegraMed. He also worked closely with the developers to
    create a form generator tool for the client to be able to more easily manage the business rules for
    complex forms.</p>
<p>As an Experience Design Lead at Isobar, Oren has lead a team of junior designers through the design
    process from user research and product definition through launch. These projects include responsive
    solutions that account for various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, phone, large monitors and
    TVs. He has also facilitated increased collaboration between the design team, developers, and business
    analysts. Between projects, Oren presented his work to the wider UX design community at Isobar, helped
    manage the New York Device Lab, and is actively involved in the NowLab.</p>
<p>Oren's experience at Isobar includes designing mobile apps, desktop applications, and large-scale web
    applications for clients such as Bloomberg, Sotheby's, MSCI, D. E. Shaw, NBCUniversal, Google, Umpqua
    Bank, The Wall Street Journal, IntegraMed, the U.S. Air Force, Genral Motors, Altar'd State, Flexport,
    Baker Hughes, and Cisco.</p>
<p>Oren's other interests include visual and creative design—especially photography and typography—and
    working the latest, cutting-edge technologies such as wearables, smart things, and VR/AR/MR experiences.
</p>
<p>In 2008, Oren received his B.S. in Software Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and in
    2010, his Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<h3>Baker Hughes</h3>
<p>Baker Hughes is an energy technology company that builds oil and natural gas rigs, all the requisite parts for the rigs, and offers services and support for their products. In 2007, Baker Hughes had joined General Electric, but were poised to become independent again at the end of 2019. Firstborn and Isobar were hired to help launch a new, responsive website that would be separate from General Electric and that would align with the new brand.</p>
<p>We were initially tasked with defining the minimum viable product—the least that Baker Hughes would need to announce it’s brand—for launch three months later. We would then go on in the second phase,to evolve the MVP design for the full transformation of their old digital presence.</p>
<p>Initially, during Phase 1, we were trying to balance having a minimal, menu-less primary navigation bar with allowing the user to browse the full depth of products and services. The product tree could be 8 levels deep in places. So I developed two options for secondary and tertiary navigation of products and services on a single page. </p>
<p>After the client reacted positively to the navigation in the first option and the product layout of the second option we started to flesh out a combined solution. However, one we stepped back and discussed the options with our engineering team, we realized we wouldn’t have time to put anything so complicated into place. Additionally, while the client’s product team liked the solution, the business units were still trying to determine how the products and services would be grouped on the new website.</p>
<p>So in our next iteration, we made the decision that for MVP, the site would only feature their two most important product solutions. These would each get detailed pages of their own, and keep the navigation simple for the initial launch.</p>
<p>When we then turned to designing the product pages for the full site transformation, we were able to develop a richer navigation system both in the navigation bar and on the page.</p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>Despite the close collaboration between our team and the client’s team, there could have been more honest communication about our respective visions for the site early on when defining the MVP. Our ambitions designs didn’t align with how they were redefining themselves and led to an outsized amount of time being allocated to iterating on the navigation and product pages.</p>
