<h2 name="bio">Bio</h2>
<p>Oren is a User Experience Designer with formal training and experience in user research, wireframing,
    interaction design, usability testing, and prototyping.</p>
<p>Oren just wrapped up a two-year detailed design effort for web-based patient and clinical portals for
    fertility clinics that have partnered with IntegraMed. He also worked closely with the developers to
    create a form generator tool for the client to be able to more easily manage the business rules for
    complex forms.</p>
<p>As an Experience Design Lead at Isobar, Oren has lead a team of junior designers through the design
    process from user research and product definition through launch. These projects include responsive
    solutions that account for various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, phone, large monitors and
    TVs. He has also facilitated increased collaboration between the design team, developers, and business
    analysts. Between projects, Oren presented his work to the wider UX design community at Isobar, helped
    manage the New York Device Lab, and is actively involved in the NowLab.</p>
<p>Oren's experience at Isobar includes designing mobile apps, desktop applications, and large-scale web
    applications for clients such as Bloomberg, Sotheby's, MSCI, D. E. Shaw, NBCUniversal, Google, Umpqua
    Bank, The Wall Street Journal, IntegraMed, the U.S. Air Force, Genral Motors, Altar'd State, Flexport,
    Baker Hughes, and Cisco.</p>
<p>Oren's other interests include visual and creative design—especially photography and typography—and
    working the latest, cutting-edge technologies such as wearables, smart things, and VR/AR/MR experiences.
</p>
<p>In 2008, Oren received his B.S. in Software Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and in
    2010, his Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<h3>Cisco</h3>
<h3>Baker Hughes</h3>
<p>Baker Hughes is an energy technology company that builds oil and natural gas rigs, all the requisite parts for the
    rigs, and offers services and support for their products. In 2007, Baker Hughes had joined General Electric, but
    were poised to become independent again at the end of 2019. Firstborn and Isobar were hired to help launch a new,
    responsive website that would be separate from General Electric and that would align with the new brand.</p>
<p>We were initially tasked with defining the minimum viable product—the least that Baker Hughes would need to announce
    it’s brand—for launch three months later. We would then go on in the second phase,to evolve the MVP design for the
    full transformation of their old digital presence.</p>
<p>Initially, during Phase 1, we were trying to balance having a minimal, menu-less primary navigation bar with allowing
    the user to browse the full depth of products and services. The product tree could be 8 levels deep in places. So I
    developed two options for secondary and tertiary navigation of products and services on a single page. </p>
<p>After the client reacted positively to the navigation in the first option and the product layout of the second option
    we started to flesh out a combined solution. However, one we stepped back and discussed the options with our
    engineering team, we realized we wouldn’t have time to put anything so complicated into place. Additionally, while
    the client’s product team liked the solution, the business units were still trying to determine how the products and
    services would be grouped on the new website.</p>
<p>So in our next iteration, we made the decision that for MVP, the site would only feature their two most important
    product solutions. These would each get detailed pages of their own, and keep the navigation simple for the initial
    launch.</p>
<p>When we then turned to designing the product pages for the full site transformation, we were able to develop a richer
    navigation system both in the navigation bar and on the page.</p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>Despite the close collaboration between our team and the client’s team, there could have been more honest
    communication about our respective visions for the site early on when defining the MVP. Our ambitions designs didn’t
    align with how they were redefining themselves and led to an outsized amount of time being allocated to iterating on
    the navigation and product pages.</p>
<h3>Flexport</h3>
<p>Flexport is a freight forwarding company that is responsible for getting products from the manufacturer to retail.
    Flexport differentiates itself from it’s competitors by providing greater transparency to its clients, assigning a
    dedicated support team to each client, and providing a freight tracking software platform. Isobar and Firstborn were
    engaged to launch a new brand and website that would reflect a maturing company with a growing focus on digital
    technology.</p>
<p>Based on initial discovery and research, I first developed some guiding design principles. Those helped us layout an
    initial architecture and page frameworks for each of the templates. I then designed wireframes to showcase the
    variability of each the template.</p>
<p>With this new identity and website, Flexport wanted to make sure that it was effective in attracting not only
    potential customers, but also investors and employees. I helped them accomplish this by first, establishing in our
    page frameworks that key benefits would be backed up by contextually relevant case studies, expert staff profiles,
    and/or articles that exhibited thought leadership.</p>
<p>I then implemented this into the design by enhancing the commonplace text & image layout with a callout that could
    contain one of these contextually relevant content pieces. This allows each marketing statement to be backed up with
    proof of Flexport’s experience and expertise.</p>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>Doing the homework of establishing design principles, a page architecture, and page layouts based on research and
    requirements went a long way towards gaining the client’s trust. As a result, our wireframe and design review
    process went smoothly and required fewer iterations on feedback.</p>
<h3>IntegraMed</h3>
<p>IntegraMed manages fertility clinics around the United States and provides software and services to partner clinics.
    Isobar had recently been asked to help design a templated system for their partner clinics’ websites. IntegraMed now
    wanted Isobar to design the next generation of software both for clinic staff and for the patients.</p>>
<p>After the team performed weeks of contextual user research and developed a conceptual interactive prototype, the work
    was broken down into two web applications: the clinic portal and the patient portal. While I helped design the parts
    of the clinic portal—especially during the second phase portions for doctors and nurses—I was primarily responsible
    for designing the responsive patient portal.</p>>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of the interface was the treatment schedule that would live on the homepage. It had
    to help the patient keep track of a complicated protocol of medications, remind them of upcoming appointments, and
    highlight any notes from the medical practitioners.</p>>
<p>In our first pass, I separated the medications into those that needed to taken in the morning and those for the
    evening. However, after speaking to some of the nurses, doctors, and patients, we realized that was insufficient.
    Medications could be prescribed for up to four times a day—morning, afternoon, evening, and before bed.
    Additionally, patients tended to remember which medication they needed to take by the timeslot and day to which it
    was assigned. As a result, in a later iteration, we increased the visual prominence of the treatment time over that
    of the medication name.</p>>
<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>While we greatly relied on insights from the initial discovery research for our designs, it was especially helpful to
    have access to users throughout the design process to be able to validate our ideas. It may have led to some more
    iterations and to disagreement between the users’ feedback and the product managers, but the application as a whole
    benefited from the feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, the engineers were included early in the design process and we remained in close, constant contact with
    them. While sometimes this meant that our more ambitions designs had to be toned down, it meant that the application
    could be designed and developed with more confidence and fewer corrections.</p>
