  <h2>Responsive redesign of Cisco Small Business (2019)</h2>
  <h3>Case Study</h3>
  <p>
    Cisco is a networking hardware manufacturer, connecting businesses of all
    sizes to the internet. Among other projects, Isobar was asked to redesign
    the product and content pages targeted at Small Businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cisco’s extensive analytics showed that a large portion of users enter the
    website via search engines. And some of those users would start their
    journey on an educational article. Therefore, the site needed to be able to
    funnel the potential customer to the relevant list of Small Business
    products and services and help them make a purchase decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we were constrained to only designing pages under the Small
    Business product team’s purview. For example, the Small Business section
    could recommend a specific product line that is optimized for small
    businesses, but the actual product lines’ and models’ pages were controlled
    by another business unit. So we needed to help the user understand the
    differences between product lines make a more informed decision about which
    product line was best for them before leaving the Small Business section.
  </p>
  <p>
    To accomplish this, we worked with the content team to make sure the
    information on the page all had a distinct purpose and place in the
    hierarchy to drive the user to their decision point. We then made sure the
    customer could get to and from the Small Business product pages with ease. I
    also introduced elements such as a high-level comparison table and an
    updated navigation bar that mapped to the business’s journey of connecting
    it’s employees to the internet.
  </p>
  <h3>Learnings</h3>
  <p>
    The client had too restrictive of a design system and over-optimized for
    mobile to the point that the desktop site lacked a sense of visual
    hierarchy. The client initially enforced those boundaries, but once we
    showed them how it would limit our design solutions, they loosened the slack
    on the reins. Once we were allowed to explore more creative options, the
    client became enthusiastic about the future of the design and became our
    partner in pushing it through the organization.
